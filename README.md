# rapidannotator

_This is my [Google Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4720430959558656/#6346511479209984) Project with [Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/)._

The entire codebase was a part of Google Summer of Code project.

With Red Hen Labâ€™s Rapid Annotator we try to enable researchers worldwide to annotate large chunks of data in a very short period of time with least effort possible and try to get started with minimal training.

Rapid Annotator is built using _Flask (Python Framework) and Javascript (+ Html5 / css3 / bootstrap)_. 

I have made a GSoC blog, please refer to it for my all GSoC blogposts about the progress made so far.
