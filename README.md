# Rapidannotator - 2.0

## Aim and Requirements
The goal of the project is aimed at extending the [​Red Hen Rapid Annotator​ 2.0](https://github.com/RedHenLab/RapidAnnotator-2.0), which was re-implemented from scratch as a Python/Flask application during last year's GSoC​. ​This project mainly aims to deliver a fully usable and handy product by the end of Google Code of Summer and incorporation of ​[new feature request and bug fixes](https://sites.google.com/case.edu/techne-public-site/red-hen-rapid-annotator)​. 
The ​​final product would be a complete tool for fast and simple classification of datasets and ​an administrative interface ​for the experimenters where they can conduct their annotation runs.

## About Work and Repository
I have fork this RapidAnnotator 2.0 repository from red hen._Currently, This repository contains work of [Google Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4720430959558656/#6346511479209984) Project with [Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/) done by [Vaibhav Gupta](https://github.com/guptavaibhav18197/) and enhancements based on user feedback report done by me (gulshan Kumar) during community bonding Period._

The entire codebase will be a part of Google Summer of Code project. At the end of GSoc19 I will merge this repository with its parent repository Red Hen lab's Rapidannotator 2.0.

## Benefits to Community
With Red Hen Lab’s Rapid Annotator we try to enable researchers worldwide to annotate large chunks of data in a very short period of time with least effort possible and try to get started with minimal training.
